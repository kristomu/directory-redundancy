In the test, we set up the following directory structure:

	test/one/two/	three
		 two/	four
				has files with the same names (a.txt and b.txt)
				and hashes, but in another order.
		 two/   five	has the same contents as three but also c.txt

	test/one/two/	six
				has files with the same names and different
				hashes

	test/one/two/	seven	has files with different names and same hashes

	test/two/*		same as one


When not doing any redundancy pruning, the program should return:
	test/one/two/three, test/one/two/four, test/two/two/three, test/two/four
		are all equal, with count 2
	test/one/two/six is equal to test/two/two/six (count 3)
	test/one/two/seven is equal to test/two/two/seven (count 2)
	test/one is equal to test/two (count 11)

and the others are not equal. We could try contains later.

With pruning, we should get
	test/one is equal to test/two (count 11)
And then, unless it's maximally pruned, either
	test/one/two/three is equal to test/one/two/four (count 2)
or
	test/two/two/three is equal to test/two/two/four (count 2)

and that's it.
